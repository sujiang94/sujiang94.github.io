I am a postdoctoral scholar in the department of [Energy Science and Engineering](https://ese.stanford.edu) at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu). I received my Ph.D. in Energy Resources Engineering from **Stanford University** in 2022, working with Prof. [Louis J. Durlofsky](https://profiles.stanford.edu/louis-durlofsky). Before joining Stanford, I graduated with honors from **Tsinghua University**, with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering and a dual degree in Economics.

My reseach lies in the intersection of **data assimilation, scientific machine learning, decision making under uncertainty, subsurface energy development and environmental problems.** I have developed approaches for inverse problems and uncertainty quantification for subsurface flow, CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage, and environmental systems using machine-learning and deep-learning techniques. My research goal is to develop **computationally efficient data-driven and physics-informed machine learning, data assimilation, and optimization techniques** for **environmental systems** and for applications relevant to the **energy transition and climate change.**
