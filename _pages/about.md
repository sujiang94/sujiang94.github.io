I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Earth and Environmental Sciences Area](https://eesa.lbl.gov) at **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)**. I completed my Ph.D. in [Energy Resources Engineering](https://ese.stanford.edu) at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu) from **Stanford University** in 2022, working with Prof. [Louis J. Durlofsky](https://profiles.stanford.edu/louis-durlofsky). Prior to that, I graduated with honors from **Tsinghua University**, with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering and a dual degree in Economics.

My research lies in the intersection of **data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, scientific machine learning, and subsurface flow simulation**. This includes applications in **CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage, seawater intrusion, subsurface energy development, and battery modeling.** I have developed approaches for inverse problems and uncertainty quantification in subsurface flow, energy storage, and environmental systems, using machine-learning and deep-learning techniques. My research goal is to develop **computationally efficient, data-driven and physics-informed machine learning, data assimilation, and optimization methods** for **environmental and energy systems** and for applications relevant to the **energy transition and climate change.**
